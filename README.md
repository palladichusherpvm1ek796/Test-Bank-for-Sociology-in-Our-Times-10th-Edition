  * This best-selling comprehensive book conveys the relevance of sociology by presenting a timely collection of theories, research, and examples-including its signature first-person accounts that open many chapters. Experiences represented in these opening vignettes accurately mirror the richness and complexity of society, while also establishing the themes that are carried throughout the chapters. Author Diana Kendall's vivid and inviting writing style, emphasis on applications, and eye for the most compelling current examples highlight sociology's relevance to all readers. Now in its Tenth Edition, SOCIOLOGY IN OUR TIMES is acclaimed in the field for being the first book to integrate race, class, and gender issues, and for its thorough presentation of sociological theory, including contemporary perspectives such as feminism and postmodernism.
